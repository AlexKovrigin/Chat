# Chat

Hi!

This is a brand new chat,
to set up a server you need to start the application and that's it!

To connect to a server you have to log in / sign in, you need a server ip and your name,
to protect your account we've made that each user has its one and only ip,
so if you want to lo gin to someone else's account, well that's impossible.

Enjoy!
